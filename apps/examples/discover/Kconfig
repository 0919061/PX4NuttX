	---help---
		Enable the netutils/discover utility.  This example initializes and
		starts the UDP discover daemon. This daemon is useful for
		discovering devices in local networks, especially with DHCP
		configured devices.  It listens for UDP broadcasts which also can
		include a device class so that groups of devices can be discovered.
		It is also possible to address all classes with a kind of broadcast
		discover.

config NETUTILS_WEBSERVER
	bool "uIP web server"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support for the uIP web server.  This tiny web server was
		from uIP 1.0, but has undergone many changes.  It is, however,
		still referred to as the "uIP" web server.

if NETUTILS_WEBSERVER

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE
	bool "Disable %! scripting"
	default y if NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE
	default n if !NETUTILS_HTTPD_SENDFILE
	---help---
		This option, if selected, will elide the %! scripting

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_CGIPATH
	bool "URL/CGI function mapping"
	default n
	---help---
		This option enables mappings from URLs to call CGI functions.  The
		effect is that the existing httpd_cgi_register() interface can be
		used thus:

		const static struct httpd_cgi_call a[] = {
		{ NULL, "/abc", cgi_abc },
		{ NULL, "/xyz", cgi_xyz }
		};

		for (i = 0; i < sizeof a / sizeof *a; i++) {
		httpd_cgi_register(&a[i]);
		}

		Where (under CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_CGIPATH) the "/xyz" is a URL path,
		rather than a %! xyz style call in the existing manner.

		This is useful when CONFIG_NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE is defined.

		In other words, this provides a way to get your CGI functions called
		without needing the scripting language. I'm using this to provide a
		REST style interface over HTTP, where my CGI handlers just return a
		HTTP status code with a content length of 0.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_SERVERHEADER_DISABLE
	bool "Disabled the SERVER header"
	default n
	---help---
		This option, if selected, will elide the Server\: header

choice
	prompt "File Transfer Method"
	default NETUTILS_HTTPD_CLASSIC

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_CLASSIC
	bool "Pre-processed files"
	---help---
		Traditionally, the uIP-based webserver only sends "files" that have
		been prepared as a data structure using nutts/tools/mkfsdata.pl

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_MMAP
	bool "File mmap-ing"
	---help---
		Traditionally, the uIP-based webserver only sends "files" that have
		been prepared as a data structure using nutts/tools/mkfsdata.pl
		However, extensions have been contributed.  If this option is
		selected, then files can be accessed from the NuttX file system
		as well.  This selection will map the files into memory (using mmap)
		so that the logic is still basically compatible with the classic
		approach.

config NETUTILS_HTTPD_MMAP
	bool "sendfile()"
	select NETUTILS_HTTPD_SCRIPT_DISABLE
	---help---
		Traditionally, the uIP-based webserver only sends "files" that have
		been prepared as a data structure using nutts/tools/mkfsdata.pl
		However, extensions have been contributed.  If this option is
		selected, then files can be accessed from the NuttX file system
		as well.  This selection will use the NuttX sendfile() interface
		to send files.  NOTE: if this option is selected, then scripting
		must be disabled.
